The goal of this tutorial is to make a dashboard using Reagent.

Assuming you already have the latest version of Java and Leiningen installed:

`lein new figwheel dashboard -- --reagent`

This generates a new lein project using reagent and figwheel. I probably want to
minimize this, but let's start with basics for now.

Let's focus on doing and then writing this after. Could also buffer switch here.

After starting the REPL with `rlwrap lein figwheel` and connecting it to the
browser, type `(in-ns 'dashboard.core)` to switch to being in that namespace.
`@app-state` to inspect the state.

What do we want?

- use a REST API
- show collections and individual things
- be responsive, work in all browsrs
- work offline
- provide auth

Ok, two hours, a start. Not far, but a start. A bit of yakshaving with thre
printer stuff, which is OK I guess.

Fix the xhr req things. Do a similar pattern to what you did before with app.
