Given an input string and a dictionary of words, segment the input string into a
space-separated sequence of dictionary words if possible. For example, if the
input string is “applepie” and dictionary contains a standard set of English
words, then we would return the string “apple pie” as output.

He also gave a number of constraints: The dictionary provides a single
operation, exact string lookup, and is a given to the task; you are not to
consider how to implement the dictionary, nor or you to worry about stemming,
spelling correction, or other aspects of the dictionary. The output may have
more than two words, if there is more than one solution you only need to return
one of them, and your function should indicate if there are no solutions.
