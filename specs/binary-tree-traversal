Implement pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal of a binary
tree. As you visit a node, perform an arbitrary function.


In addition to traversing a tree in pre-order or post-order, you
should write functions that reconstruct the original tree given a list
of the tree nodes in pre-order or post-order.
