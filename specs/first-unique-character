Write a function that takes an input string and returns the first character from
the string that is not repeated later in the string. For instance, the two
letters “d” and “f” in the input string “aabcbcdeef” are non-repeating, and the
function should return “d” since “f” appears later in the string. The function
should return some indication if there are no non-repeating characters in the
string.
