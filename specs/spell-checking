Build a spell checker based on tries. For example, a trie containing
'car', 'cart', 'cat' and 'dog' should return that 'cat' is a valid
word by following c-branch then a branch then t branch, then
end-of-word indicator. Contrariwise, 'qarter' should return false
quicker than hashing (read one character vs six characters).
