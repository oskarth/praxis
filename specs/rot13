Write a function that takes a string and returns the ROT13 version of the
string; you may assume that the character set is ascii. What is the meaning of
“Cebtenzzvat Cenkvf vf sha!” The simple Caesar-cypher encryption that replaces
each English letter with the one 13 places forward or back along the alphabet,
so that “The butler did it!” becomes “Gur ohgyre qvq vg!”
