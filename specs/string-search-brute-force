Write a function that takes a pattern and a string and either returns the index of the first location of the pattern or an indication that the pattern is not present in the string; an optional third argument allows the search to start at an arbitrary point in the string. Our pattern is simply a fixed string; unlike regular expressions, there are no meta-characters. Brute-force: place the pattern at each possible location in the search string and compare character-by-character to determine if there is a match.
