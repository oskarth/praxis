*September 28, 2015. RPN Calculator in Clojure. Took too long, several attempts
and on the order of three hours. Code is too verbose and error-prone. Required
googling multiple times, but never looked up solution.*

*September 29, 2015. Yegge's phone screen questions in Clojure. Took too long,
~2h, and too verbose. Required a bit of googling. OK error handling.*

*September 30, 2015. Sieve of Eratosthenes in Clojure. OK but getting stack
overflow for n > ~1e5 (need ~1e7), despite using loop-recur. After googling and
looking up answers it seems as if one problem might be with me using multiply
rather than addition, but don't know why that would impact the stack. ~1h time.*
